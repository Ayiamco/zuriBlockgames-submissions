# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deployAyiamcoERC20.js
npx hardhat help
```

#To run the deploy script

- Create a .env file in the root directory
- Add the following variables ALCHEMY_URL=<Your Alchemy Url or some other node provider like Infura> ACCOUNT=<Your private key>
